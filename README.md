# The Pigeon Hole

[The Pigeon Hole](https://torontopubliclibra.github.io/pigeon) is an application for viewing images of pigeons in different cities around the world. It is written in HTML, jQuery, and CSS, uses the Flickr API, and was originally built in July 2022 during my time at Juno College. The site retrieves JSON data objects representing photos of pigeons, either in the user's selected city or in a random city, it shuffles through those image objects, and then it displays one of the photos on the page.
